# To-Do List Application

This is a simple to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, remove tasks individually, clear all tasks, and automatically stores tasks using local storage.

## Features

- Add new tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- Remove individual tasks by clicking the "Remove" button next to each task.
- Clear all tasks by clicking the "Clear All" button at the bottom of the list.
- Tasks are automatically stored in local storage, so they persist even after closing the application.

## Getting Started

To use the application, simply install the '.apk' file on your phone. You can add tasks by typing them into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. To remove a task, click the "Remove" button next to it. To clear all tasks, click the "Clear All" button at the bottom.

*Note: Toast has been added and is currently not visible due to free branding of the apk converter website.*
